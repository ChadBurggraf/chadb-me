h3. i.AM Search

p(byline). Discover the best autism apps for iOS

i.AM Search is an iOS app and server platform built to help those in the autism community discover high quality apps in the iTunes App Store. The iOS app includes the ability to search, save, and share apps discovered using dimensions such as age, grade, independence level, and problem domain (communication, self-awareness, etc.). 

The server platform hosts a JSON API for speaking with the app, as well as management tools for app curation such as automatic scraping from iTunes, a developer dashboard for data intake from app developers, and workflow management to take apps from input through review and publication.

h3. Serialization.Plists

p(byline). Binary plist serialization and de-serialization for C# and .NET

Serialization.Plist is a binary plist read/writer implementation for .NET. It supports the complete plist specification that Apple has published, with two caveats:

* Serialization of opaque data or non plist-compatible objects will break plist editing in Property List Editor.
* Sets are treated as arrays.

h3. WMD

p(byline). WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) Markdown editor

WMD is a fork of StackOverflow's fork of the original WMD developed by John Fraser. The project is a complete re-architecture of StackOverflow's original de-obfuscation in 2008. The goals of the project were:

* Clean up the external API to make it easier to understand and interact with
* Allow for OO-style WMD instance creation, including multiple instances per page
* Provide a clean mechanism for extending the editor with custom commands
* Maintain library independence, as StackOverflow claimed to be introducing a jQuery dependency

h3. SWFClipboard

p(byline). JavaScript clipboard interface

SWFClipboard acts as an interface between JavaScript and the system clipboard. The script allows developers to provide copy/paste features on websites via a clean, simple API (with no dependencies):

* Instantiate as many SWFClipboard instances as necessary on a page
* Dynamically set which element triggers a copy operation, even after the SWFClipboard instance has been created
* Dynamically set the text to copy, even after the SWFClipboard instance has been created

These features enable easy development of advanced scenarios, such as "ghosting" the mouse with an SWFClipboard instance in order to provide dynamic copy targets.

h3. Survey Engine

p(byline). Enterprise data collection and reporting platform

Survey Engine is a platform for creating, distributing and reporting on large data collection initiatives. Distributed as white-labeled, custom installed software, the system boasts many features geared towards advanced data collection scenarios:

* Drag and drop interface
* Arbitrarily long forms with many advanced question types
* Advanced form features such as skip logic, preconditioned questions, custom validation, inter-question validation, conditional pages, versioning, etc.
* Advanced reporting features such as automatic summation and segregation, predicated time series, automatic dimensional time series, and an extensible plug-in system
* Integration features such as an Application API for form, respondent, and report integration; and a Respondent API for form submission and data collection

Survey Engine currently powers the Council for Juvenile Justice Administrators' Performance-based Standards data collection, which won the Innovations in American Government award from Harvard University, as well as a number of other data collection initiatives.

h3. Virtual Keychain

p(byline). Easily manage all of your web sites, logins, and passwords

Virtual Keychain is an online password management database. Implemented as a static HTML page interacting with a JSON API, it allows users to store account credentials securely and anonymously. 

The application has been online and available free of charge since 2006. Although not the most advanced password database available, its stability, ease of use, and anonymity have proved valuable to those that depend on it.
